# Web app generator with LESS

Edited default Yeoman generator for scaffolding out a front-end web app with Twitter Bootstrap in LESS


## Getting Started

- Make sure you have [yo](https://github.com/yeoman/yo) installed: `npm install -g yo`
- Install the generator: `npm install -g generator-lessapp`
- Run: `yo lessapp`
- Run `grunt` for building and `grunt server` for preview

## Options

* `--skip-install`

  Skips the automatic execution of `bower` and `npm` after
  scaffolding has finished.

* `--test-framework=[framework]`

  Defaults to `mocha`. Can be switched for
  another supported testing framework like `jasmine`.
